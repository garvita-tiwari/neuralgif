We present Neural Generalized Implicit Functions (Neural-GIF), to animate people in clothing as a function of body pose. Neural-GIF learns directly from scans, models complex clothing and produces pose-dependent details for realistic animation. We show for four different characters the query input pose on the left (illustrated with a skeleton) and our output animation on the right.
